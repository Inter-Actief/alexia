    <h2>Status</h2>
    <p>
        Version 1 of the API is currently stable but still in development. All methods in this document are considered
        stable.
    </p>
    <p>
        Undocumented additional methods may be available but are unstable and can be changed without notice. Also
        optional paramenters and new fields in result values can be added to existing methods.
    </p>

    <h2>Basics</h2>
    <p>
        This API of Alexia is based on JSONRPC. The JSONRPC client must support cookies. Using named parameters instead
        of positional parameters is highly encouraged.

    <h2>Authentication</h2>
    <p>
        Authentication can be performed by any valid RADIUS username password combination. The user must have the
        manager role for most of the currently available methods.
    </p>
    <h3>Authentication flow</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Call <a href="#method_login">login(username, password)</a> to authenticate.
        </li>
        <li>
            Call <a href="#method_organization.current.set">organization.current.set(organization)</a> to select current
            organization.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        When a client is authenticated with the <a href="#method_login">login</a> method the username and password
        parameters of other methods can be omitted.
    </p>
